Below you will find the ABC's of learning. Having a openmind and a positive outlook will allow you to overcome a grasp any infomartion athe you are trying to obtain.



 A –  I am ALWAYS learning. Learning doesn’t end when the school bell rings. It is a life-long process. Even grown ups make mistakes and learn from them to do better next time.

B – Mistakes make my BRAIN grow. If you believe you can learn from your mistake, your brain actually works harder to learn from it.

C – I want a CHALLENGE. One of the best parts of having a growth mindset is how much you love to be challenged. Once you are able to accomplish a hard thing, you can’t wait to tackle the next hard thing.

D – Things are DIFFICULT before they are easy. Think of a baby learning to walk. At first, it seems like they will never figure it out. Then suddenly, they let go of the couch and walk across the floor. Everything you know how to do now was once really hard.

E –  I focus on my EFFORTS. You cannot always control how something turns out, but you can control how hard you work.

F –  I listen to FEEDBACK from others. You have trusted adults who want to help you get better at what you are doing. Listening and applying their advice will help you improve.

G – I GROW when I make mistakes. Once you learn from your mistake, you will not make the same mistake in the same way ever again. Over time, that growth will lead to mastery.

H – I ask for HELP when I need it. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign that you want to get better.

I – I’m INSPIRED by the success of others. Someone else doing it first just means it can be done!

J – Success is the JOURNEY, not the destination. Remember how you are always learning? Even once you achieve your goal, you will set another harder goal. Success is found in the process of achieving more and more difficult objectives.

K –  KEEP trying is my personal motto. If at first you don’t succeed…

L – Mistakes are a part of LEARNING. How boring would it be if you could do everything perfectly the first time you tried?

M – My brain is like a MUSCLE; work makes it stronger. And who doesn’t love the idea of a big, beautiful muscular brain?

N – My NEURONS are firing and brain is growing. Your brain is a miraculous organ. At no point in your life is it ever completely silent. When you are learning, new pathways are being created that will last a lifetime.

O – There is always another OPPORTUNITY. You may not get to go back in time and redo this very minute, but you will always be able to create other opportunities to try again.

P – My goal is PROGRESS, not perfection. Are you better today than you were before? You’re moving in the right direction!

Q – I ask QUESTIONS when I don’t understand. The greatest thinkers of our day made incredible, life-altering discoveries by first asking questions. It’s a great place to start on your journey!

R – I am RESILIENT. Being resilient is more than bouncing back after a setback. It’s bouncing back even better than before!

S – Struggling makes me STRONGER. Frederick Douglass once said, “Without struggle there is no progress.”

T – I keeping TRYING until I get it. Trying isn’t a half-hearted effort, it’s giving everything you’ve got even if you aren’t sure you’ll succeed.

U – I take time to UNDERSTAND my feelings. In today’s fast-paced world it’s sometimes hard to sit and evaluate why we are feeling the way we are. But pausing and understanding our feelings help us recognize when we are frustrated, when we need to take a step back, when we are ready to take on a new challenge, and when we need a rest.

V –  I will have VICTORY over my circumstances. You are more than the product of where you have come from. Even if your home life isn’t ideal, that doesn’t mean you can’t be successful.

W – WORK is my path to achievement. The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.

X –  A little eXtra effort will yield big results. Even if you are ready to quit, giving a little more of yourself may be the push you need to get over this hurdle.

Y – I haven’t figured it out YET. There is power in the word “yet”. I don’t know how – yet. I don’t have the skills – yet.

Z –  I am ZEALOUS about learning new things. Zeal is great energy or enthusiasm. When you are zealous, you approach learning new things with excitement!
